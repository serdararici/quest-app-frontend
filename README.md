# QuestApp Frontend

This is the **frontend of QuestApp**, a full-stack social media-style application built with **React**.  
It connects to the [QuestApp Backend](https://github.com/serdararici/quest-app) (Spring Boot) to provide a complete user experience, including authentication, posts, comments, likes, and profile management.  

> 🚀 Developed with **React, Vite, and Material UI** to create a responsive, modern, and user-friendly interface.  
> 🎓 This project was built as part of my learning journey to combine backend and frontend into a full-stack application.
